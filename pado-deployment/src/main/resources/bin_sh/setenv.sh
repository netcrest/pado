#
# You may change this file to assign environment variables. At a minimum,
# you must set the "REQUIRED" environment variables. The "OPTIONAL" 
# environment variables are mostly for building Pado and running GemFire
# tools. All third-party dependencies are specifed in this file. 
#

#
# IMPORTANT: The following environment variables are set by this file.
# They are used by Pado internals and scripts. Do not set them manually.
#
#  $PADO_HOME - The absolute path of the Pado directory. Same as $BASE_DIR.
#  $BASE_DIR - The absolute path of the Pado directory. Same as $PADO_HOME.
#

#
# REQUIRED: The following environment varirables are required to run Pado.
#
#  $JAVA_HOME - Java home directory path.
#  $GEMFIRE - GemFire home path.
#

#
# OPTIONAL: The following environment variables are optional. Please see
#           details further down in this file.
#    $SSH_USER - The remote SSH user name used to establish ssh connections.
#             Set this variable only if the login user names are different.
#    $REMOTE_BASE_DIR - The remote base directory path. Set this variable
#             only if the base directory in the remote hosts is different
#             from this host's base directory.
#    $COMMAND_PREFIX - If you need to run Pado as root, set this variable to sudo. 
#             All commands will be run with this prefix. For example, if it
#             is set with sudo, then start_server_local is exectued as 
#             "sudo start_server_lcoal".
#

#
# Application specifics:
#    $APP_PROPERTIES - Application specific system properties and JVM settings
#             should be set using APP_PROPERTIES. See the APP_PROPERTIES section
#             below for setting system properties. Note that APP_PROPERTIES
#             overrides Pado settings set by start_server.
#    $APP_JARS - This environment variable is automatically set to include all
#             jar files in the $BASE_DIR/lib directory and its 
#             subdirectories. If you want to include other jar files or 
#             class directories then include them in APP_JARS. You might need 
#             to reorder the files listed in APP_JARS if you have multiple versions
#             of classes. If so, prepend the proper jar files. APP_JARS is 
#             found below.
#    $USER_CLASSPATH - Instead of using APP_JARS which also include Pado jars, 
#             you can set your library class paths using this environment
#             variable. Note that USER_CLASSPATH is placed in front of CLASSPATH.
#             You can change the order where USER_CLASSPATH is included in this
#             file.
#
# Note that the class path constructed by this script is used by all executables,
# i.e., cacheserver, gfmon, databrower, vsd, and gfsh.
