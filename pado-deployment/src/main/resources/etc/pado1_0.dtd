<!-- path defines a single grid path name space that uniquely identifies a
dataset managed by the underlying data grid. path can be nested to create
a hierarchical name space.
Attributes:
inherit - If inherit is "true" then it inherits parent attribute values for
       all undefined attributes. The default is true. 
data-type - If "partition", then the dataset is partitioned across all grids
       that define the same path. If "replicate", then the dataset is replicated as a whole
       to all grids that define the same path. If "local" then the
       data is written to only one of the grids. The default is "local".
grids - List of grid IDs that this path spans across. For data=type="partition",
        If any of the listed grids is not reachable then the partitioned path 
        is not accessible by clients. An appropriate exception will be thrown.
        For other data types, IBiz operations are limited to the grids list 
        by this attribute. If this attribute is not set, then by default, all 
        of the grids are allowed.
temporal-enabled - true to enable temporal data. The default is false.
lucene-enabled - true to enable Lucene indexes for the path.
       The default is false.
lucene-verbose - If true, Lucene index status is logged upon dynamically 
       creating new indexes.
key-class-name - If key-class-name is specified then only objects of that
       class type are allowed as keys. If temporal is true then
       this class automatically becomes IdentityKey of ITemporalKey.
value-class-name - If value-class-name is specified then only objects of
       that class type are allowed as objects. If temporal is true and this
       class does not implement ITemporalData then this class automatically 
       becomes Value of the wrapper class TemporalData.
router-class-name - This class overrides the default cost-based router.
refid - The reference ID of the path defined by the underlying data grid. 
       For example, the id attribute value of GemFire "region-attributes".

<!-- GemFire -->
<!-- gemfire defines GemFire specific parameters which include both grid 
and client configuration information.
Attributes:
locators - Comma separated list of site locators. Each grid may have one
       or more sites. The locators must be specified in the comma separated 
       format: host1:port1,host2:port2.
is-parent - If true then the specified grid is a parent grid that may host 
       child grids. If false then the specified grid is only a child grid. 
       Note that all grids including parent grids are child grids. Default: false.
init-delay - Initialization delay in msec. GemFire may invoke the Pado 
       initializer before fully initializing the distributed system due to 
       the nature of GemFire’s lazy initialization mechanism which applications
       do not have control. This attributes is provided to handle such
       situations by delaying the Pado initializer from launching prematurely.
grid-info-update-delay - GridInfo update delay in msec. Pado generates 
       heartbeats in the form of GridInfo objects between child and parent
       grids. If one of the grids has time-consuming initialization sequences,
       then this attribute may be required to postpone generating the initial 
       heartbeat. Note that the default value is conservatively set to
       10,000 msec, but in most cases, this value should be set to 0 msec.
       Default: 10000.
grid-info-update-interval - GridInfo heartbeat interval in msec. All grids
      generate heartbeats regardless whether they belong to a parent. When a 
      parent grid starts, it listens on each child grid’s heartbeats and 
      records their status. Because grids tend to run in an extended period of
      time with the same configuration, in most cases, the frequency of
      heartbeats can be relaxed to minutes. For debugging purposes, this value
      can be lowered but in normally it should be set to a large value. 
      Default: 60000
root-region-path - The full path of the root region. If this attribute is not
      specified, then the grid ID becomes the root region path. All grid
      specific regions must be created as sub-regions to the root region.
      Default: <grid-id>.
router-region-total-num-buckets -  Total number of buckets for the router
     partitioned region. This value is set to a number of internal partitioned
     regions that provide grid services. It must be set to at least the same
     number of GemFire cache servers that make up the distributed system.
     Default: 113.
pool-name - Pool name for child grids and clients. This pool name is bound to
     RegionService, i.e., multi-user mode. If undefined, then it is assigned
     to <grid-id>-pool.
shared-pool-name - Shared pool name for child grids and clients. A shared pool
     is not bound to RegionService such that multiple users can share the 
     regions that are configured with it. If undefined then it is assigned in
     the following order:
        1. index-matrix-pool-name
        2. <gemfire-client> shared-pool-name
        3. <grid-id>-shared
index-matrix-pool-name - Index Matrix pool name for child grids and clients.
     In most cases, this value is same as shared-pool-name. To isolate index
     matrix load, its own pool can be dedicated. If it is undefined, then it
     is assigned in the following order:
        1. shared-pool-name
        2. <gemfire-client> index-matrix-name
        3.<grid-id>-shared
