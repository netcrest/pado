Release Date: 12/19/2016

- Fixed a data load bug in import_csv which incorrectly shared the same NumberFormat object in a non-thread-safe manner.

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.4.0-B1
Release Date: 12/06/2016

- Initial open source release. There are two (2) known issues to this release. 1) The scripts in the bin_sh/ directory must be manually changed to executables by executing "chmod -R 755 *". 2) Javadoc is not part of the distribution.
- Functionally, this release is same as 0.3.2-B6. 
- There are changes in Pado jar files. lib/pado.jar is now lib/pado-core.jar. lib/pado-hpim.jar and lib/pado-temporal.jar are merged into lib/pado-core.jar and lib/pado-gemfire.jar. lib/pado-data.jar is merged into lib/pado-core.jar. pado-temporal-test.jar is merged into lib/pado-test.jar. lib/pado-jsonlite.jar and lib/pado-jsonlite2.jar have been removed. plugins/pado-gemfire-biz.jar has been renamed to plugins/pado-biz-gemfire.jar.

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.2-B6
Release Date: 11/20/2015

- Added support for SSH_USER and REMOTE_BASE_DIR for executing bin_sh/ scripts by a different user from a different Pado installation directory.
- Added support for ranked Lucene result sets. Introduced the new key words "rank by..top" in PQL syntax, i.e., "<path>?... rank by <field name> top <number of records>". This implementation works only with non-KeyType JsonLite objects.
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.2-B5
Release Date: 11/11/2015

- Fixed a temporal search bug that returned duplicates. This bug was a side effect to the temporal search fix made in the previous release.
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.2-B4
Release Date: 11/07/2015

- Added support for managing server entries in any order in bin_sh/grids/<grid>/server_<site>.sh file. Servers can be listed in any order and server numbers can now be skipped as long as they are unique numbers.
- Added add_server and remove_server for adding and removing servers without manually modifying the bin_sh/grids/<grid>/server_<site>.sh file. In conjunction with start_server and stop_server, these scripts can be used to dynamically add or remove servers.
- Enhanced bundle_grid to support 'conf', 'lib', 'db', 'data', and 'all' types.
- Added deploy_bundle to deploy bundles to all servers.
- Added the 'rebalance' command in PadoShell. In addition to rebalancing the specified partitioned paths, this command also automatically updates Pado internals. This command is preferred to GemFire gfsh's rebalance. See README.txt for details.
- Fixed the redundancy recovery mechanism that now correctly rebuilds temporal and Lucene indexes during failover. Prior to this fix, Pado relied on the master/slave failover entry point to trigger the rebuild process, which turned out to get invoked prematurelly before the GemFire redundancey recovery has fully completed. Because of this unpredictability of GemFire API, Pado now rebuilds temporal and Lucene indexes from BucketRebalanceResourceObserver which requires all partitioned regions to be configured with startup-recovery-delay="-1" and recovery-delay="0".
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.2-B3
Release Date: 10/18/2015

- Fixed the bug that locked up concurrent IndexMatrix queries. This was caused by Pado clients improperly unregistering GemFire region interests from Cachelistener leading to a deadlock condition.
- All bin_sh server management scripts now start servers in parallel by default. To start servers in sequence, specify the new option '-serial'. The '-parallel' option has been deprecated.
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.2-B2
Release Date: 10/11/2015

- Added support for PROP_HOME_DIR. Clients can now set pado.home.dir to set the working directory.
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.2-B1
Release Date: 10/04/2015

- Added script/run_test.pado for quickly testing Pado installation. This script creates a temporary path, lists paths, inserts data, queries and displays data, lists path, removes the temporary path, and lists paths. See README.txt for details.
- By default, all trusted keys generated by Pado utilities and examples are stored in security/pado.keystore.
- Updated security scripts in ldap/example/ssl to store trusted keys in security/pado.keystore.
- Added support for GemFire 8.2 and JDK 1.8. Pado now supports GemFire 7/8 and  JDK 7/8.
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.1-B4
Release Date: 09/27/2015

Release Date: 08/16/2015

- Overhauled the security mechanics to support multiple sessions per a single client VM.
- Introduced IUserPrincipal to provide user role information upon successful login.
- Added support for LDAP authentication.
*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.3.0-B1
Release Date: 07/17/2015

- Merged HPIM code into the Pado trunk.

- Introduced "lucene-enabled" in pado1_0.dtd to enable Lucene per grid path.
- Renamed "temporal" to "temporal-enabled" in pado1_0.dtd.

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.2.1-B1
Release Date: 05/05/2015

- Added support for individual server designation by introducing locator_<site>.sh and server_<site>.sh in the bin_sh/grids/<grid-id> directory. Each locator and server can now configured on an individual basis as opposed to the previous scheme of determining server configuration based on the total number of servers.
- Overhauled bin_sh scripts to remotely and locally manage grid components.
- Added refid support in pado.xml to reference GemFire region-attributes IDs defined in etc/<grid>/server.xml.
- Temporal lists are now re-enabled during startup as a workaround to handle dropped cache listener events of persistent regions during startup. This may be a GemFire bug.
- Lucene indexes can now optionally be built during server startup. To enable it, set build-lucene-index="true" for the path-list tag in pado.xml.
- mkdir has been renamed to mkpath in PadoShell. mkpath includes support for refid.

*************************************************************************

- Enhanced PadoShell as follows:
  - Added new PadoShell commands: fg, jobs, version
  - PadoShell now supports background jobs. The suffix '&' runs the command in background. To display, all running commands, run the new command, 'jobs'. To wait for all running jobs to complete, run 'fg'.
  - Added the '-e' option to execute a list of PadoShell commands separated by ';' from the OS shell.
  - Introduced '-f' to execute a script file form the OS shell.
- Fixed the clean scripts that did not remove GemFire cache server PID files. With this fix, all grids and sites can now be restarted in parallel.

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.2.0-B3

- PadoShell features the "grid" command for attaching and detaching grids from the parent grid. A child grid can now be readily attached to or detached from the parent grid allowing isolation of "bad" grids.

Release Date: 01/21/2015

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.1.0-B7
Release Date: 01/06/2015

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.1.0-B6
Release Date: 12/18/2014

*************************************************************************

Release: Version 0.1.0-B4
Release Date: 11/18/2014

- Added support for Virtual Paths. A virtual path performs schema-on-read with embedded entity relationships in real time. It is essentially a series of PQL query statements that join physical and/or virtual paths across one or more grids providing the appearance of a grid path. The end result has the similar effect as a physical path which can be in turn searched via PQL.
- Added IDQueueBiz that wraps the GemFire DQeueue add-on.
